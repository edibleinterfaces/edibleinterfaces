[ concerns ]

don't keep apps on separate domains. previx edibleinterfaces with <appname>.edibleinterfaces.
building app of apps. how to use vue-cli for this?  to get HMR, time travel etc.
git submodules. how to reflect app of apps in code management to isolate components from one another?
updates and stored config: what happens when an app update involves a config change? migration path?
config loading.  load all configs up front? only load app configs that have been used / pinned? Seems like the router and storage will have to interact when each app is loaded.
